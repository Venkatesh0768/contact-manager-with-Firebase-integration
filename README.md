Contact Manager Application - Project Overview

Today, I completed a project called Contact Manager as part of my Android development assignment. This project marks my introduction to Android development, and I'm proud to say I was able to complete it successfully.
Features of the Application:

User Sign-Up:
I implemented a sign-up page where users can register by entering their details. The information is then securely stored in Firebase, with the username acting as a unique identifier.

User Login:
The login page allows existing users to sign in by providing their username. The app checks Firebase to verify if the user exists before granting access.

Main Application (Contact Management):
Once logged in, users can store their contact details in the app. After entering the contact information and clicking the "Save" button, an alert box confirms that the details have been successfully stored in Firebase.
Users can also view the saved contact details by clicking on the "View Data" button, which retrieves and displays the data from Firebase.
